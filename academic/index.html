	  <p><b>Description: </b> </p>
	  <p><small>When I was in my junior year, I took one independent studying course exploring numerical methods for pricing and hedging the risk of American Put Options supervised by Professor Kenneth Jackson. In contrast to binomial lattice models, the numerical and computational method priced the options more accurately as well as promised more effective methods for hedging the risk.
